# ocCraft
This is a little videogame originated trough a very little OpenComputers game jam.
It is currently not much more as the engine but should be easy to modify as long as you have a little practice with lua.

# Modding
You can install/create your own texture packs (also with different resolution) as well as mods with new blocks, entities and biomes (world gen)*.

*(technically you can change nearly anything at runtime because the most data are stored in a local table named global which will given to any script at loading.)

# Installation
To play the game you need Minecraft with forge and the OpenComputers mod installed.
On the OC PC you just need to download and run the setup file (https://pastebin.com/7h1xNZgt).


I hope you like the project and have a little bit fun :>
