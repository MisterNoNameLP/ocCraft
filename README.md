# ocCraft

This is a little project originated in trough a very little OpenComputers game jam.
It is currently not much more as the engine but should be easy to modify as long as you have a little practice with lua.

#Installation:
To play the game you need Minecraft with forge and the OpenCOmputers mod installed.
On the OC PC you just need to download and run the setup file.
